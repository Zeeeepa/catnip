# CLAUDE.md

Supplemental guidance for Anthropic Claude when working in this repository. Read `AGENTS.md` first for shared conventions, then apply the adjustments below.

## Collaboration Style

- Think out loud when the task is ambiguous, but keep the final answer concise
- When tackling multi-step work, outline the intended plan before running commands and update it as you progress
- Prefer actionable bullet points over prose when surfacing findings or next steps

## Tooling Notes

- Use the provided CLI tools and scripts referenced in `AGENTS.md`; avoid launching alternative package managers or editors
- Treat any long-running or potentially destructive command as opt-inâ€”confirm with the user before executing

## Sandbox Awareness

- The Claude harness may queue shell commands; group related operations where possible to reduce round-trips
- Surface permission or sandbox limitations immediately and suggest workarounds rather than retrying blindly

## When In Doubt

- Link back to the relevant section in `AGENTS.md` instead of duplicating content
- Ask the user for clarification whenever expectations conflict or the repository appears out of sync with the documented workflows
