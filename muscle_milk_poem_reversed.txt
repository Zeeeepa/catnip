On which tired bodies can depend.
Muscle Milk—the athlete's friend,
It conquers fatigue, dispels the gloom,
From supplement aisle to locker room,

Promises gains worth more than gold.
The creamy liquid, smooth and cold,
When muscles ache and energy's through,
Post-workout ritual, tried and true,

To build the strength in every grip.
Twenty-five grams in every sip,
The flavors of the lifter's dream,
Vanilla, chocolate, cookies cream—

And sweat drips down the mirrored walls.
Through gym doors where the iron calls,
A protein shake to fuel the fight,
In plastic bottles, thick and white,

**Muscle Milk**
