**Muscle Milk**

In plastic bottles, thick and white,
A protein shake to fuel the fight,
Through gym doors where the iron calls,
And sweat drips down the mirrored walls.

Vanilla, chocolate, cookies cream—
The flavors of the lifter's dream,
Twenty-five grams in every sip,
To build the strength in every grip.

Post-workout ritual, tried and true,
When muscles ache and energy's through,
The creamy liquid, smooth and cold,
Promises gains worth more than gold.

From supplement aisle to locker room,
It conquers fatigue, dispels the gloom,
Muscle Milk—the athlete's friend,
On which tired bodies can depend.
