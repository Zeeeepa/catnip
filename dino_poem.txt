In valleys deep where fossils sleep,
Great dinosaurs once roamed,
With thunderous steps and mighty necks,
Through prehistoric homes.

T-Rex with teeth like daggers sharp,
Triceratops with horns,
Brontosaurus stretched up high,
To greet the ancient morns.

Velociraptors hunted swift,
Stegosaurus wore his spikes,
Pterodactyls soared on high,
While Earth was young and wild.

Though millions of years have passed away,
Their bones still tell their tale,
Of giants that once ruled the earth,
Before time pulled their veil.
